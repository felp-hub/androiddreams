				Through the lens of science fiction storytellers across the globe have envisioned worlds of advanced technology and unfathomable futures. Worlds where society itself no longer resembles the world of reality.
			</p>
			<p>
				How could Johannes Kepler ever envision man walking on the moon when he wrote 'Somnium' in 1634. Yet over 300 years later, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first men to do just that.	
			</p>
			<p>
				For years Sci-Fi has been able to predict, predate and portray real world developments, with varying degrees of success. This writing will focus on the accuracy of science fiction in portraying real-world developments of artificial intelligence.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's believed that artificial intelligence first appeared in fiction over two hundred years ago with Mary Shelly's 'Frankenstein' (1818). This precedes the first real world studies of artificially intelligent machines by over a hundred and fifty years.
			</p>
			<p>
				To answer the question posed by this essay, a number of films, novels and games were selected to act as a timeline, charting the ideas and appearances of AI in Sci-Fi from Isaac Asimov's 'Runaround' written in 1942, to Denis Villeneuve's 2017 film, 'Blade Runner 2049.''

			<h3>Plotting the course</h3>
			<p class="lrg-p">
				When choosing what stories to examine for this study the following criteria was considered:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Artificial intelligences prominence within the fiction</li>
					<li>The social significance of the fiction</li>
					<li>The inspiration for the fiction</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				While the chosen stories may not meet all the listed criteria, they all met enough to be relevant and provide significant instances of AI to examine when asking how accurate Sci-Fi has been in portraying artificial intelligence.

				Turing to terminators

			<p class="lrg-p">
				Artificial Intelligence exploded onto screens during the 80s, when Rick Deckard set out to retire the Nexus-6 Replicants in Ridley Scott's cult classic 'Blade Runner'  (1982) and the despotic Skynet began its crusade to destroy human life in James Cameron's 'The Terminator' (1984).

			But before the Terminator's T-800's and Gibson's hyper-intelligent Neuromancer came Alan Turing. The brilliant British scientist, who after working as a codebreaker during the second world war, began to 'wonder about the intelligence of the machines used to break the Enigma code'.

			A few years later Turing published his seminal article 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' (1950) hailed by many as one of the first articles describing artificial intelligence. 

			Six years after, the phrase artificial intelligence was coined when Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy hosted an eight weeklong Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence (DSRPAI).

			Minsky would go on to cofound the AI lab at MIT in 1970 and continue to research and develop artificial intelligence throughout his career.

				Runaround Robots

			<p class="lrg-p">
				Alongside the rise of AI as an academic study in the real world, many of the landmark themes of AI fiction came into being.

			In ‘Runaround’ (1942), Isaac Asimov introduced the world to his “Three Laws of Robotics”, telling a story about Speedy, an AI robot becoming caught in a loop and running around in a circle as a result of these three laws.

			At the time of writing, no such technology existed of course, but Marvin Minsky discussed how ‘Runaround’ had a lasting impact on his life and work, remarking that after reading it he “never stopped thinking about how minds might work.” Later Minsky even became friends with Asimov.

			As an inspiration it’s clear that ‘Runaround’ inspired some of the greatest minds in the formative years of AI. But has that inspiration lead to the technology found in ‘Runaround’ being replicated in the real world?

			Well yes… and no.

			In 2019 a scene reminiscent of Speedy trapped in the loop, endlessly running in circles was seen at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport when an unmanned catering cart began circling out of control, spiralling towards a parked jet before eventually being stopped.

			The cart was neither autonomous nor AI-equipped. There was no instance of an AI being caught in loop trying to obey its master. As NBC reported, it was more likely a  stuck accelerator that caused the incident.

			<h3>Hostile HAL</h3>
			<p class="lrg-p">
				Stanley Kubrick’s ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ (1968) saw one of the world’s greatest directors tackle science fiction and artificial intelligence in a film that sees the crew of ‘The Discovery One’ face off against the rogue AI HAL whilst traveling to Jupiter.
			</p>
			<p>
				The screenplay for the film co-written by Kubrick and Arthur C Clarke whose novel of the same name was released after the film and short story ‘The Sentinel’ inspired the film and novel.

		<div class="col-5">
			<p class="lrg-p right-rev">
				HAL was one of the first instances of humans communicating with a computer via spoken language. This film was also one of the first where a director employed a real-world scientist to advise on the set of the film. Kubrick invited Marvin Minsky, prolific AI scientist and Sci-Fi fan, to provide advice on HAL and other technology seen in the film. This ensured that ‘2001:A Space Odyssey’ was grounded in reality.

				Many of the leading AI scientists at the time believed that talking machines like HAL were only a few decades away. Writing in 2020 however, has proved this estimate to be inaccurate. While technology like Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Home devices give the appearance of speaking to a machine, the AI seen here merely mimics a sentient machine replying to a person. The responses given by Alexa are stored on the cloud and rather than giving the user a response that is original, the machine instead provides one of over 70,000 stored online.
			</p>
			<p>
				This illustrates fiction’s habit of often using real world science as an influence when generating ideas for artificially intelligent systems yet veering too far into the unknown when it comes to the actual depiction AI characters.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-3">
		</div>
		<div class="col-3 bottom-rev">
			<p>
				But even Amazon has addressed the similarities to HAL and Alexa by providing a reference to the 1968 classic. When someone asks Alexa to ‘open the bay doors’ a line asked by one of the astronauts in the film, Alexa replies “I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that. I’m not Hal and we’re not in space”.

				The 80s was a seminal decade in Sci-Fi cinema, and at the forefront of this was Blade Runner (1982).

			<p>
				Based on Philip K Dick’s ‘Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep’ (1968), both film and novel explore a world of AI androids and dystopian futures. And whilst robotics is always developing, Replicants found in the film, remain a distant pipe dream.

			<p>
				As a result of this, many of the artificially intelligent machines imagined in ‘Minority Report’ are seen in some form today, from driverless cars to predictive policing.

				Minority Report features a chase scene involving the protagonist in a driverless car, a technology only in its infancy when the movie released but as of 2018 Nvidia unveiled a new self-driving chip, Xavier incorporating AI.

				One addition was ‘Joi’ the holographic AI companion to the film’s protagonist. A depiction that has received criticism from female writers who felt the depiction of Joi appealed to the stereotypical stay at home wife tropes.

					Whether the criticism is fair is debateable, however with an industry worth $30 billion, the sex technology industry has continued to develop life sized, hyper realistic sex devices.

					The same year the film was released Abyss Creations revealed a prototype for the ‘RealDoll’ named ‘Harmony.’ Harmony is the culmination of 20 years of work and is said to be able to hold a conversation but when compared to Joi, she remains nothing but a toy, almost laughable compared to the sophisticated AI portrayed in the film.

					The Joi found in the ‘Blade Runner 2049’ is fully sentient, and can make decisions regarding her fate and existence, and along with the other major AI characters in the film, namely the replicants, seems destined to exist solely in fiction for the foreseeable future, or at least well beyond the year 2049 in which the move is set.

			<h3>To Conclude</h3>
			<p class="lrg-p">
				AI has been present in fiction for hundreds of years. When assessing how accurate the depiction of AI in fiction has been in portraying the real-world application of the technology, the results are varied to say the least.
			</p>
			<p>
				‘Minority Report’ is unchallenged in its depiction of future technology. From AI powered driverless cars to predictive policing, all these technologies depicted in the film have gone on to become reality.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even a film like “2001: A Space Odyssey” a movie that featured an AI as advanced as HAL has been accurate at least in predicting a future where spoken language is used to communicate with computers, even if HAL remains a distant future for devices like Alexa and Google Home.
